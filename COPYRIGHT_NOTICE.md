DRAFT, NOT OFFICIAL YET

# General copyright notice for "Captain Holetooth"

Hello everyone,

The game is open source and can be modified and used as stated in the Apache License.
This file is here only to clarify how the art files are handled.

I'm publishing paid ebooks and print books with my characters, so I need to apply some basic form of protection.

If you really can't help yourself, want to use my art elsewhere or hire me to do work for you, please get in contact with me: team@hirnbix.com

*I'm open and like to communicate with everyone who is showing interest.*

## You are not allowed to:

* Use the exact character designs of the "Captain Holetooth Game" 1:1 in other works of art
* Copy story elements 1:1 into other games or other works of art

## You are free to:

### Create your own stories based on mine
It is totally fine with me if you take the basic plot with the crashing ship and modify it.
Just make sure the ship looks different and the Captain is not called "Captain Tootholio" :)
      
### Use my art for education purposes or as a starting point for more art
If you want to show the source to design students or other artists, feel free to do so! You can also use the source files as a starting point for your own creations.

Kind regards

Oliver
