##Captain Holetooth - the Videogame!

The "Captain Holetooth" explorative platformer lives in a unique, story packed world. 
A cast of amazing characters helps Captain Holetooth to defend the "magic candy" (working title). 
This game is based on my books, so some work has already been done in terms of story.

* Deep backstory, rich world 
* Explorative nature is appealing to many audiences 
* Characters are revealed during gameplay
* Episodic content or chapters are planned (at least 5 short chapters are already written)
* Godot Engine powered and an Alpha Version is already available for **Mac, Android, Linux, PC.**

##Downloads
